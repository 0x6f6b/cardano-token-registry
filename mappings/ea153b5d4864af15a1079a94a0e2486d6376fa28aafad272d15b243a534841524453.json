They are accumulated via holding a Badge of Honor (airdropped 50%), staking a Badge of Honor with SaturnNFT.io (30%), and are rewarded at an ultra-low drop rate for battling in PFP Pit Brawl (20%). These tokens will be necessary to craft Legendary Weapons, Armor, Relics. etc. Each Legendary object in PFP Pit Brawl will require varying amounts of $SHARDS. There will only ever be 1,000,000 $SHARDS !! pfppb.io"
